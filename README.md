This is an implementation of RRT global planner plugin for ROS melodic. 
This planner uses cubic bezier curve to produce smooth paths which are curvature continuous.
A good inspiration of basic RRT global planner for this code was by "Craig Miller (https://craigdanielmiller.com/2021/10/23/rrt-global-planner-for-ros/)".
